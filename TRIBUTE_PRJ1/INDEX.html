            <h2>Basketball legacy</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                Bryant was called "one of the greatest players in the history of
                our game" by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and The New York
                Times wrote that he had "one of the most decorated careers in
                the history of the sport".
              </p>
              <p>
                Reuters called him "arguably the best player of his generation",
                while both Sporting News and TNT named him their NBA player of
                the decade for the 2000s.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked him the second-greatest
                shooting guard of all time after Jordan. Players including Kevin
                Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose called
                Bryant their generation's version of Jordan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Press-Enterprise described Bryant as "maybe the greatest
                Laker in the organization's history". He was the Lakers'
                all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the
                most in franchise history. Both numbers he wore during his
                career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18,
                2017.

            <h2>Player profile</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at 6
                feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg), though Bryant
                himself said that he was 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m), or "probably"
                6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) in shoes.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the
                NBA. Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons to Jordan, after whom
                he modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, he became most known
                for shooting a fall-away jump shot.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of
                Bryant's most famous moves as the "jab step-and-pause": Bryant
                jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax, but
                instead of bringing the jab foot back, he pushed off of it and
                drove around his opponent to get to the basket.

            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>
              At 9:06 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky
              S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County,
              California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old
              daughter Gianna, six family friends and the pilot. The helicopter
              was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp.,
              according to the California Secretary of State business database.
              The group was traveling to a basketball game at Bryant's Mamba
              Academy in Thousand Oaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to light rain and fog that morning, the LAPD helicopters and
              most other air traffic were grounded. The flight tracker showed
              that the helicopter circled above the L.A. Zoo due to heavy air
              traffic in the area. At 9:30 a.m. the pilot Ara Zobayan contacted
              the Burbank Airport's control tower, notifying the tower of the
              situation and was told he was "flying too low" to be tracked by
              radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and
              turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40 a.m. the helicopter
              climbed rapidly from 1,200 to 2,000 feet (370 to 610 m), flying at
              161 knots (298 km/h; 185 mph).
            </p>
            <p>
              At 9:45 a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain
              in Calabasas, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of downtown Los
              Angeles, and caught on fire. Bryant, his daughter, and the other
              seven occupants were killed. This also started a quarter-acre bush
              fire. At 9:47 a.m. authorities were called. Los Angeles County
              Fire Department firefighters responded to the scene, and
              paramedics rappelled from a helicopter to the scene to look for
              survivors. The fire was difficult to extinguish due to the
              presence of magnesium, but the fire had been extinguished by 10:30
              a.m. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter crashed in the
              hills above Calabasas in heavy fog. Witnesses reported hearing a
              helicopter struggling before crashing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cause of the crash is still unknown, as the helicopter was not
              equipped with a black box. The Federal Aviation Administration,
              National Transportation Safety Board, and the FBI have launched
              investigations into the crash.
